## Recovery about to begin

Several sessions with the specialist later, and it's all coming up Milhouse - got cleared for surgery almost 7 weeks after the injury (finally). We had to wait for the swelling to go down because if the range of motion isn't there, then post-op there might be complications. 

Testing my mobility was the atrocious - it was like doing the worst practical assessment of all time. I would lay my leg out straight on the hospital bed in the specialists office and he would make me  gingerly bend my knee whilst he and my mother would keenly watch from the side. Sometimes it would be still bent whilst on the bed, and my knee wouldn't be able to bend more than 90 degrees and we'd just look at each meekly. This probably happened at least twice, and each time he'd say a phrase never thought I would come to dread, "we want that mobility to be 0-110 degrees, why don't you see me in 10 days?".

So now we finally have the all clear for surgery next week LET'S GO and I can start the road to recovery. Although this has been probably one of the worst starts to a year I've had to date, the support from loved ones and friends has been incredibly wholesome and the solidarity from all my other surgically inclined homies has been so lovely. 

For all the real ones out there thanks for continually thinking of me - this one's out to you fams.
