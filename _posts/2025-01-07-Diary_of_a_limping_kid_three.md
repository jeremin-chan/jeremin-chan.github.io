## Pre op shenanigans

After going to sleep for several hours I now have 2 new knee ligaments! What a time to be alive.  

I didn't have anything to eat or drink that morning as per the doctor's orders, and I smelt a bit like vinegar because the pre-surgical wash I used that morning was a little funky, I checked into the hospital bright and early. After some paperwork and a looooot of waiting on the hospital bed in my lil hospital gown, someone measures my height and weight and I'm pleasantly surprised. I haven't lost much weight (but I'm sure most of the muscle has turned into fat at this point) and I somehow grew 1cm so huzzah for that. Maybe someone should take my other leg out and I can finally get to 180cm? Haha

They bring me through the pre-op check in station right before I go to an operating room, and I have a brief chat with the anaesthetist, who is actually a friend of my sister, and he's chatting with me to distract me from the big ass needle he puts into my left arm to administer the drugs. 

In the operating room it's a lot brighter than how I imagined in the movies, with quite a few people inside ready to do the op and of course my friendly surgeon there leading the show. I scoot across from my hospital bed to the operating table thing during which there's some upbeat pop music playing that's just scooch too loud. One of the surgical people tells me to breathe into the mask, it's oxygen and that's the last thing that I remember until I wake up.

## Ugggghhhhhhhhhhhh

I have no idea what the time is, but I'm in the hospital room and some nurses saying something to me. I mumble something like, "no thanks I'm a little tired" and then close my eyes again.

I wake up again and another nurse is asking me if I'm ok and now it's a little darker. My mum softly says my name to my left and I excitedly say her name and give her hand a quick squeeze. I'm still a little out of it and it's so darn distractedly noisy but I later learnt that this was because it was visiting hours so there was a bit of bustle about the hospital - fair. At this point the background noise is getting to me so I drowsily slur to the nurses, "hey it's so noisy can I just get discharged and rest already?" I don't think I was in any shape to be discharged yet which is hilarious so I think the response was a strong no.

Some dinner comes and it's a bit of pasta, broccoli and also a banana for dessert. I can't fathom having any of the pasta at that point so my lovely mum feeds me some of the broccoli, and the steamed veggies is a welcome addition to my very empty stomach, which I proceeded to completely void into a sick bag. Oops those anaesthesia drugs and pain meds are strong. I feel immensely better and then maybe 30 minutes later the surgeon comes in to check on me, which is impressive because it's probably at least 7pm at this point. I'm wolfing down the banana because I'm trying to get all that potassium and fibre and whilst he's chatting to the nurses about my post-op condition I proceed to fill another sick bag. Whoooops - ok maybe it's not quite time to be discharged yet. 

## New knee, new me

I sleep in and out aided by some strong pain meds and that evening I need to go bathroom but it's been almost 18 hours since I last emptied my bladder. I need to get help to get up in case I fall, so I ask the nurse to help me up and I hop on over to the bathroom. It actually took me two tries, and almost 40 minutes of concentrating and the threat of a catheter as an alternative to give me the push I needed to relax the muscles and go. Scary stuff thank god I didn't have to do that. Each time I had to ask for pain meds I had to recite my name and date of birth to consent to pain management, and by the 3rd time I had my lines rehearsed down to a tee. Helped with sleep immensely though. 

The next morning I'm greeted by the specialist at around 7am, almost 12 hours after he wished me good evening and that is crazy dedication. That morning has a looooooot of waiting in gusty air-conditioning for orderlies to pick me up and drop me off at different parts of the hospital but I finally manage to get discharged and go home hooray! The next check up is in 2.5 weeks and I have to keep my knee locked straight until the specialist says otherwise. 

So looks like it's still going to be a few more weeks of one legged fun.
