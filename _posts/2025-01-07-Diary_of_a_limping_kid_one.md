## The night of

On January 7th I was training at my local BJJ gym, it was a warm night and I was feeling good. On the last round of the night, I asked Jai, a young 18 year old for a quick round of sparring. We were both trying to get position but no one was able to advance. In the final minute of the round, he went for a double leg takedown, cut the angle and I went to face his direction to try and plant my feet backwards and defend. Next thing I know, this man leaps forwards and I feel a force impacting my right side, hear a godawfully loud crunch and my right knee is in a lot of pain. 

I knew something was wrong because my knee went numb as hell and my body went into shock. He heard and felt everything and knew it was in a bad shape too. A few agonising weeks later waiting for the swelling to go down, the scans revealed some bad news. Maybe someone made a 2-for-1 deal for me that fateful night because turns out my PCL was fully torn and my MCL had a Grade 3 tear. The specialist recommended surgery and said it would take around 10-12 months to rehab this injury, so as far as injuries go this takes the cake. Because it's my right foot, I currently can't drive so it feels like I'm in junior school all over again - waiting for someone to pick me up and drop me off, how silly.
