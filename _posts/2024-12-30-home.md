A short and sweet camping trip between Christmas and New Years down south with Mel and a new friend Michelle. Senyi, Jill and Jerry were able to join a day after us too. A classic SWWA road trip to do the hikes in the Stirling Range national park. We picked Toolbrunup -- where you have to scramble up and over a landslide of rocks to get to the peak, and the Nancy's peak/Devils slide loop in the Porongorups which I haven't done before. The two big mountain ranges in the area, covered in a weekend. After the hikes each day we'd go to the beach to wash off the sweat. On the first day we went to Little Beach, which might be my new favourite in the area. It has the Esperance essence; the sheltered rocky bay, crystal clear light blue water, and squeaky white sand. But it is also relatively close to Albany town, and therefore a convenient drive. And then the classic Middleton beach on the second day, so that we could enjoy a pub dins immediately after. A trip of typical camping meals, bakery pies and pastries for food, lots of laughs, and excessive hippocampus use. A great holiday to wrap up Mel's time back in Australia.
